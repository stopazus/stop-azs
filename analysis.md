# Investigative Analysis Memorandum

## Background and Overview
Investigators traced approximately $7 million of misappropriated victim funds through a City National Bank (CNB) attorney trust account (no. 2304977980) controlled by Justin Zeig. Victims wired proceeds from legitimate property sales; Zeig allegedly commingled the deposits through his IOTA account, then disbursed them to shell entities and offshore channels. A forensic accounting review shows rapid inflows for legitimate payoffs, and Zeig aligned outgoing wires to match the trust balance each cycle, highlighting the layering stage of money laundering where origins were intentionally obscured to mirror ordinary escrow reconciliations.

## Key Entities and Accounts
- **Zeig IOTA Escrow:** Originating attorney trust account used for commingling.
- **Pass-through Accounts:** #2304977980 and #2000043165557 moved funds to unvetted beneficiaries.
- **Beneficiaries:** YBH Holdings LLC, Eisenstein Buyers, and layered offshore accounts tied to Zeig-controlled structures.

## Evidence Collected
1. IC3 Submission ID 7065f60922b948a59af3a8654edb16dd referencing diverted escrow proceeds.
2. Internal AML alerts showing routing inconsistent with escrow instructions dated 9 February 2023.
3. Subpoena requests to Banesco USA for dollar amounts and UETR identifiers supporting federal task force inquiries.

## Analytical Conclusion
Transaction patterns, beneficiary overlap, and rapid reconciliation behavior indicate deliberate layering and potential structuring designed to defeat escrow compliance controls. Recommend immediate coordination with FinCEN, FBI, and IRS-CI to expand tracing, preserve records, and prepare for asset recovery litigation.
