# Investigative Data Brief

## Overview
- The dataset mirrors the IC3 filing for escrow diversion tied to IC3 Tracking ID 7065f60922b948a59af3a8654edb16dd, along with the SAR submission metadata and filer identifiers for N & S Holding LLC.
- Structured coverage includes the confirmed 2023-01-11 Banesco → City National Bank of Florida wire, pending subpoena trails, entity rosters, property records, affidavit authorities, and preserved communications.

## Confirmed activity
- Posted transaction: $206,693.68 transmitted on 2023-01-11 from Banesco USA escrow to the Zeig Law Firm PLLC IOTA account, contradicting trust instructions.
- Alias resolution: bank correspondence tied the previously unresolved 2733 NW 198th Terrace reference to the confirmed 2763 NW 196 Terrace address in Miami Gardens, FL.

## Outstanding follow-up
- Key gaps remain around UETR identifiers, beneficiary account numbers, and control verification for 3049 Perriwinkle Circle; dependencies point investigators to bank subpoenas and property record reviews.
- Bank follow-up directives insist on complete customer histories, KYC files, and routing confirmations from Banesco USA and City National Bank of Florida, with reminders to escalate missing records.

## Evidence and communications
- Attachments catalog SAR exhibits, closing instructions, layering diagrams, and legal summaries for reference when assembling case packets.
- Banesco advice-of-debit emails from January and February 2023 are preserved with parsed Received-path hop metadata to support subpoena traceability.

## Tooling shortcuts
- Reusable command snippets in the dataset document jq and Python helpers for validation, exports, and Received-chain extraction from any workstation (Windows instructions included).
- Investigators should execute the snippets from the repository root, as echoed in the main README’s command highlight section.
