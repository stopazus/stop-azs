# Involved Parties

## Overview
This document summarizes the principal individuals and entities identified in N & S Holding LLC's whistleblower filings, forensic reports, and law-enforcement escalations concerning the alleged diversion of escrow funds tied to the Perriwinkle Circle real-estate transaction.

## Parties of Interest
- **Justin Zeig (Esq.)** – Formerly of Zeig Law Firm PLLC, disbarred by the Florida Bar in December 2024. Allegedly served as escrow agent while controlling the origin of deposits. Filings assert he misappropriated client funds and facilitated laundering.
- **Hasia Bitton** – Real-estate agent and principal of YBH Holdings LLC (including YBH Holdings 2948 LLC). Identified as a key coordinator who controlled bank accounts and shell companies used to route escrow funds. Transaction analysis shows layering patterns passing through her accounts.
- **YBH Holdings LLC / YBH Holdings 2948 LLC** – Bitton-managed entities alleged to have operated as nominee special-purpose vehicles to obscure fund sources and destinations. Internal tracing links YBH Holdings 2948 LLC to structured ETH transfers.
- **Zeig Law Firm PLLC** – The firm that maintained the IOTA trust account for the Perriwinkle Circle sale. The trust account is central to the alleged diversion: escrow deposits were rerouted through the firm's accounts instead of reaching the sellers.
- **Daniella & Zachary Eisenstein** – Sellers (debtors) of 3049 Perriwinkle Circle and intended recipients of escrow proceeds. N & S Holding LLC argues their transaction was tainted by the diversion and seeks remedies against all parties involved.
- **N & S Holding LLC (Land Trust)** – Purchaser of 2763 NW 196 Terrace and secured lienholder on Perriwinkle Circle, represented by Trustee Sharon Topaz. Identified as the victim of the diverted escrow (approx. $206,693.68) and currently pursuing recovery while cooperating with federal authorities.
- **Nu World Title LLC** – Title company originally holding escrow funds for the Eisenstein transaction. Investigative findings indicate Nu World Title disbursed funds under false pretenses, bypassing trust instructions; the company is treated as a secondary victim.
- **Yossef Ben-Hamo / "Ben-Hamo Group"** – Israeli national and unlicensed broker tied to Bitton-controlled shell entities. Associated accounts and wallets suggest cross-border layering and foreign involvement in the laundering scheme.

## Alleged Scheme Highlights
- Escrow deposits were allegedly simulated through entities controlled by Justin Zeig, rather than bona fide buyers.
- Zeig Law Firm's IOTA trust account reportedly laundered at least $206,693.68, with funds redirected to unrelated transactions via shell companies.
- Forensic blockchain and banking analysis map flows from Zeig-controlled wallets (over 1,000 ETH) to Bitton-controlled wallets (over 2,700 ETH) in structured transfers consistent with layering typologies.

## Law-Enforcement Engagement
- FBI/IC3 complaint (Case ID: 7065f60922b948a59af3a8654edb16dd) links the diversion to Zeig Law Firm and Bitton-associated entities.
- Confirmed losses include the $206,693.68 initial diversion, with additional analysis suggesting total damages exceeding $253,000 and potentially reaching $739,490 across related accounts.

## Recommended Investigative Actions
1. Subpoena financial and telecommunications records for Zeig, Bitton, YBH entities, and associates to confirm account ownership and transaction authorization.
2. Trace Zeig Law's trust disbursements—particularly the $206,693.68—to Bitton-controlled accounts identified in internal CNB wire memos.
3. Cross-reference settlement statements, emails, and payment memos for inconsistencies and undisclosed deposits, preserving correspondence gathered by Trustee Sharon Topaz.
4. Coordinate with FBI forensic accountants and IRS investigators to share data and support asset-freeze or forfeiture proceedings.

## Tax and Compliance Concerns
- Potential failure to report diverted escrow proceeds as income by Zeig and Bitton.
- Use of laundered funds to purchase real estate without tax disclosure, implicating Bank Secrecy Act provisions.
- Abuse of IOTA trust accounts to conceal funds, triggering IRS anti-laundering penalties.
- Unreported capital gains stemming from more than $5.4 million in flows through Bitton-linked entities.

## Enforcement Posture
- N & S Holding LLC has prepared UCC-1 liens, constructive trust motions, and lis pendens to secure interests in the affected properties.
- A comprehensive three-year audit is requested for Daniella and Zachary Eisenstein and affiliates, covering tax filings, bank accounts, and related real-estate transactions.
- Escalation letters to FBI and IRS explicitly seek audits, subpoenas, and inter-agency coordination involving the Florida Bar, FinCEN, IRS, and DOJ.
