# Escrow Transaction Review

## 1. Summary of Reported Activity
- **Originator:** Zeig IOTA Escrow (City National Bank attorney trust account no. 2304977980).
- **Routing:** Funds layered through pass-through accounts #2304977980 and #2000043165557 before dispersal to YBH Holdings LLC, Eisenstein Buyers, and layered offshore accounts.
- **Current Status:** Dollar amounts and UETR identifiers pending subpoena response from Banesco USA; case referenced in IC3 Submission ID 7065f60922b948a59af3a8654edb16dd.

## 2. Key Dates

- **2023-04-02:** AML Surveillance Unit escalated the matter to FinCEN and FBI via SAR filing.

## 3. Control Findings

## 5. Recommended Next Steps
1. Obtain subpoena returns from Banesco USA to confirm final dollar amounts and UETR identifiers.
2. Coordinate with federal task force partners to trace layered offshore disbursements tied to Zeig-controlled entities.
3. File civil actions to freeze and recover escrow funds, naming YBH Holdings LLC, Eisenstein Buyers, and related shell structures.
4. Initiate attorney discipline referral against Justin Zeig with the Florida Bar citing escrow misuse and suspected laundering.
5. Follow the Immediate Account Freeze Protocol to maintain interagency momentum and document freeze confirmations.
