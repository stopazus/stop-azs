# Suspicious Escrow Transaction Review

This template provides a structured outline for summarising suspicious escrow account activity and related legal or compliance actions. Replace the placeholder guidance with verified facts supported by appropriate evidence.

> **Disclaimer:** This template is intended for illustrative and educational purposes. Populate it only with information obtained through lawful investigative methods.

## 1. Background and Overview

Describe the matter under review, including:

- Timeline of relevant events.
- Description of the escrow or trust account (institution, account type, controlling party).
- Known victims or complainants and how funds were introduced into the account.
- Summary of complaints, referrals, or internal alerts that initiated the investigation.

## 2. Escrow Account Ledger Findings

Summarise the transactional activity that raised concerns. Suggested elements:

1. Notable deposit and withdrawal patterns (e.g., rapid pass-through activity, structuring, round-tripping).
2. Routing pathways used to layer or obscure funds.
3. Supporting evidence such as bank statements, wire confirmations, or third-party ledgers.

Reference any tabular analyses maintained in `data/ledger_analysis_template.csv` so the narrative aligns with the underlying data set.

## 3. Entity Mapping

Provide an overview of entities and individuals connected to the transactions. Suggested subsections:

- **Companies or accounts:** Include jurisdiction, registration details, and relationship to the investigation.
- **Financial institutions:** List correspondent banks and intermediary accounts involved in the flow of funds.
- **Key individuals:** Document roles (e.g., signatories, beneficial owners) and any known professional or familial relationships.

Verify identity information through reliable sources before including it in the memorandum.

## 4. Legal and Regulatory Actions

Outline actions taken or recommended, such as:

- Civil litigation or administrative actions.
- Professional discipline.
- Regulatory or law-enforcement referrals.
- Asset tracing and recovery efforts.

Maintain a liaison contact table so outreach and follow-up efforts remain organised:

| Agency / Team | Primary Contact | Reference Number | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |

Update the table as additional stakeholders engage or new identifiers are assigned.

## 5. Evidence Log and References

Create an index of supporting documents, including:

- Bank statements and wire transfer records.
- Corporate filings or ownership documentation.
- Affidavits, complaints, or indictments.
- Cross-references to investigative notes or case management systems.

## 6. Next Steps Checklist

Track outstanding tasks with a simple checklist:

- [ ] Confirm completeness of ledger records for the relevant date range.
- [ ] Reconcile deposits and withdrawals against victim or client loss statements.
- [ ] Verify the chain of custody for evidentiary documents.
- [ ] Coordinate with legal counsel regarding potential asset restraints.
- [ ] Prepare briefing materials for relevant stakeholders.
