# Escrow Transaction Review

## 1. Summary of Reported Activity
- **Originator:** Zeig IOTA Escrow (City National Bank attorney trust account no. 2304977980).
- **Routing:** Funds layered through pass-through accounts #2304977980 and #2000043165557 before dispersal to YBH Holdings LLC, Eisenstein Buyers, and layered offshore accounts.
- **Current Status:** Dollar amounts and UETR identifiers pending subpoena response from Banesco USA; case referenced in IC3 Submission ID 7065f60922b948a59af3a8654edb16dd.

## 2. Key Dates
- **2023-02-09:** Reported diversion of escrow proceeds from Zeig IOTA Escrow.
- **2023-03-14:** Internal audit detected inconsistent routing against escrow instructions.
- **2023-04-02:** AML Surveillance Unit escalated the matter to FinCEN and FBI via SAR filing.

## 3. Control Findings
- Escrow instructions did not authorize transfers to YBH Holdings LLC or Eisenstein Buyers.
- Layered payments reset the IOTA escrow balance after each diversion cycle, masking depletion.
- Beneficiary vetting relied on attorney attestations without independent verification or dual approval.

## 4. Legal and Regulatory Actions
Summarise actions taken or recommended, such as:

- Civil litigation (e.g., foreclosure actions, receiverships).
- Professional discipline (e.g., bar association proceedings against attorneys handling escrow funds).
- Regulatory referrals to agencies like FinCEN, IRS-CI, FBI, or state financial regulators.
- Asset tracing and recovery efforts across domestic and international jurisdictions.

Include docket numbers, filing dates, and outcomes when available.

## 5. Recommended Next Steps
1. Obtain subpoena returns from Banesco USA to confirm final dollar amounts and UETR identifiers.
2. Coordinate with federal task force partners to trace layered offshore disbursements tied to Zeig-controlled entities.
3. File civil actions to freeze and recover escrow funds, naming YBH Holdings LLC, Eisenstein Buyers, and related shell structures.
4. Initiate attorney discipline referral against Justin Zeig with the Florida Bar citing escrow misuse and suspected laundering.
