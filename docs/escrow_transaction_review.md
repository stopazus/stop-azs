# Suspicious Escrow Transaction Review

This document outlines a structured approach for summarising suspicious escrow account activity and the associated legal or compliance actions that may follow. It is designed as a template for investigators compiling analyses for regulators, prosecutors, or internal risk teams.

> **Disclaimer:** This template is intended for illustrative and educational purposes. It should be populated with verified facts and evidentiary material obtained through lawful investigative methods.

## 1. Background and Overview

Use this section to capture the key context for the investigation, including:

- Timeline of relevant events.
- Description of the escrow or trust account at issue (institution, account type, and controlling party).
- Known victim profiles and how funds were introduced into the account.
- Summary of complaints or referrals (e.g., IC3 submissions, suspicious activity reports).

## 2. Escrow Account Ledger Findings

Document the transactional pattern that raised red flags. A typical narrative might include:

1. Identification of round-tripping behaviour where deposits and withdrawals of equal amounts occur in rapid succession.
2. Routing pathways used to layer or obscure funds (e.g., pass-through shell entities, offshore transfers, money service businesses).
3. Supporting evidence from bank statements, wire confirmations, or third-party ledgers.

Where possible, pair the narrative with tabular data (see the CSV template in `data/ledger_analysis_template.csv`).

## 3. Entity Mapping

Provide a high-level overview of entities and individuals connected to the transactions. Suggested subsections:

- **Shell companies or pass-through accounts**: Include jurisdiction, registration details, and relationship to the main investigation.
- **Financial institutions**: List correspondent banks and intermediary accounts involved in the flow of funds.
- **Key individuals**: Document roles (e.g., signatories, beneficial owners) and any known professional or familial relationships.

Always corroborate identity information with public records, subpoenas, or reliable investigative intelligence before inclusion.

## 4. Legal and Regulatory Actions

Summarise actions taken or recommended, such as:

- Civil litigation (e.g., foreclosure actions, receiverships).
- Professional discipline (e.g., bar association proceedings against attorneys handling trust accounts).
- Regulatory referrals to agencies like FinCEN, IRS-CI, FBI, or state financial regulators.
- Asset tracing and recovery efforts across domestic and international jurisdictions.

Include docket numbers, filing dates, and outcomes when available.

## 5. Evidence Log and References

Create a detailed index of supporting documents, including:

- Bank statements and wire transfer receipts.
- Corporate filings for implicated entities.
- Affidavits, complaints, or indictments.
- Cross-references to investigative notes or case management systems.

## 6. Next Steps Checklist

Use this checklist to track outstanding tasks:

- [ ] Confirm completeness of ledger records for the relevant date range.
- [ ] Reconcile deposits and withdrawals against victim loss statements.
- [ ] Verify the chain of custody for evidentiary documents.
- [ ] Coordinate with legal counsel on potential restraining orders or asset freezes.
- [ ] Prepare briefing materials for regulatory or law-enforcement partners.
