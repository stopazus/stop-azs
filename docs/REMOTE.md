# Repository Remote Configuration

This working copy is configured to use the following Git remote:
- **origin**: https://github.com/stopazus/gemini-chat.git

## Verifying the remote
Run `git remote -v` to confirm the configuration. You should see output similar to:
```
origin  https://github.com/stopazus/gemini-chat.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/stopazus/gemini-chat.git (push)
```

## Updating the remote
If the remote ever needs to change, run `git remote set-url origin <new-url>`
with the replacement URL.
