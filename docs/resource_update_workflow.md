# Resource Update Workflow

**File:** `docs/resource_update_workflow.md`  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Context:** Escrow Diversion Investigation (Zeig / Nu World Title / N & S Holding)

## 1. Objective

To establish a standardized protocol for updating the investigative repository. This ensures that all forensic data—specifically the Master Ledger, UCC Filings, and Evidence Hashes—maintains a verified chain of custody suitable for submission to federal authorities (IRS-CI, FinCEN, FBI).

## 2. Directory Structure Standards

All updates must adhere to the following directory hierarchy to ensure the "Forensic Package" remains autogenerated correctly:

```
/
├── evidence/
│   ├── raw/                  # Original PDFs/Images (Bank Statements, Emails)
│   ├── hashed/               # Renamed with SHA-256 hash for integrity
│   └── ucc_filings/          # Official UCC-1 and Registry Snapshots
├── ledgers/
│   ├── active/               # Current working Excel/CSV workbooks
│   └── snapshots/            # Weekly frozen CSV exports (e.g., ledger_2025-11-22.csv)
├── docs/
│   ├── affidavits/           # Generated affidavits (Notarized scans)
│   └── reports/              # Weekly summaries for Law Enforcement
└── scripts/                  # Tools for hashing and reconciling
```

## 3. Workflow Phases

### Phase A: Evidence Ingestion

1. **Receive Data:** New assets (e.g., a new bank statement or email) are received.

2. **Sanitization:** Redact purely personal PII (Unrelated SSNs) unless required for law enforcement submission.

3. **Placement:** Save the raw file to `evidence/raw/`.

4. **Hashing:** Run the hashing script to generate a unique ID for the file.
   - **Command:** `python scripts/hash_evidence.py [filename]`
   - **Output:** Moves file to `evidence/hashed/` and appends hash to `manifest.json`.

### Phase B: Ledger Reconciliation

When new transactions are identified (e.g., tracing a new "pass-through" flow):

1. Open the Master Casebook in `ledgers/active/`.

2. **Add Row:** Input Date, Amount, Sender, Receiver, and Transaction ID.

3. **Tagging:** Apply specific tags:
   - `#LAYER_NODE` (for intermediate accounts)
   - `#ZERO_CYCLE` (for immediate in/out)
   - `#UCC_MISALIGN` (if funds bypassed a lien)

4. **Export:** Save as a CSV to `ledgers/snapshots/` with the current date (`ledger_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`).

### Phase C: Documentation & Commit

1. **Update Readme/Summary:** If critical new red flags are found (e.g., a new shell company), update the main `README.md` or `investigation_summary.md`.

2. **Git Commit:** Use a structured commit message to track the evidence chain.
   - **Format:** `[EVIDENCE] Added [Bank Name] Statements - Ref [Date Range]`
   - **Format:** `[LEDGER] Reconciled $206k diversion flow - Nu World to Zeig`

## 4. Critical Checks (The "UCC Test")

Before merging any update to the main branch, perform the **UCC Alignment Check**:

- [ ] Does the new ledger entry conflict with known UCC-1 Filings?
- [ ] If YES (Conflict Detected), document it immediately in `red_flags.md` using the standard phrasing:

  > "UCC Misalignment: Filings do not match observable asset footprints."

## 5. External Sharing

- **Law Enforcement:** Only share files from `ledgers/snapshots/` and `docs/affidavits/`.
- **Civil Counsel:** Share `evidence/hashed/` via secure link.
