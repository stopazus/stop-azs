# Life-to-Date Timeline Summary

This briefing consolidates the key timeline markers cited across the Periwinkle Circle dispatch materials. Each milestone links
back to the specific document or artifact where it appears so analysts can quickly trace evidence threads without rereading the
entire packet.

## Usage Notes
- Treat the timeline as a navigational aid; consult the cited source documents for verbatim language or additional context.
- When preparing regulatory responses, pair each milestone with the corresponding checksum evidence maintained in the dispatch
  archive to confirm chain-of-custody.
- Update this table if subsequent reviews surface corrected dates or additional milestones; maintaining a single authoritative
  chronology reduces rework across audit teams.
