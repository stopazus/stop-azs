- **Loss calculation:** Provide a spreadsheet showing gross loss, recovered amounts, and net exposure to support exigent freeze requests.

## 2. Primary Bank Freeze Request (Immediate Call)
1. **Contact CNB Fraud/Legal Hotline:** Use emergency escalation channels to request a post-transaction hold on the Zeig IOTA escrow account and pass-through beneficiaries. Provide the evidence packet, emphasize ongoing law-enforcement investigation, and cite attorney trust violations.
2. **Invoke escrow breach and suspicious activity:** Reference fiduciary obligations under Florida Bar Rule 5-1.1 (Trust Accounts) and CNB’s BSA/AML rapid response procedures.
3. **Document confirmation:** Request written acknowledgment of the freeze request, case number, and assigned investigator. Log call times, personnel, and commitments for follow-up.

### Phone Script Highlights

- State that $7M in escrow funds were diverted on 9 February 2023 to YBH Holdings LLC and Eisenstein Buyers without authorization.
- Reference IC3 Submission ID 7065f60922b948a59af3a8654edb16dd and demand immediate holds to prevent further dissipation pending law-enforcement seizure orders.

## 3. Recovery Asset Team (RAT) Escalation (Within 1 Hour)
- **Agency:** FBI – Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), Recovery Asset Team (RAT).
- **Action:** Email RAT using the IC3 portal contact with the evidence packet and bank contact details. Request they transmit a Financial Fraud Kill Chain (FFKC) notice to CNB and receiving institutions.
- **Follow-up:** Confirm RAT issuance of the hold request and obtain their agent of record for direct coordination.

## 4. Parallel FinCEN SAR Update (Same Day)
- **Agency:** FinCEN – BSA E-Filing Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).
- **Action:** Submit an urgent SAR update identifying the diverted funds, beneficiary accounts, and law enforcement case references. Tick the “Urgent” box and include a request for 314(b) rapid information sharing.
- **Outcome:** Use SAR confirmation number to reinforce requests with CNB and correspondent banks.

## 5. IRS-CI Referral (Within 24 Hours)
- **Agency:** IRS – Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI).
- **Action:** File a referral citing potential Title 26 and Title 31 violations, attaching bank records, beneficiary information, and the IC3/RAT acknowledgement. Request preservation letters to implicated financial institutions.

## 6. Secondary Receiving Bank Actions
1. **Identify downstream banks** for YBH Holdings LLC, Eisenstein Buyers, and offshore accounts (Belize, Ben-Ham structures).
2. **Send emergency hold letters** referencing the RAT notice and forthcoming court orders. Include wiring details, transaction timestamps, and beneficiary due-diligence failures.
3. **Leverage 314(b) partnerships** to request voluntary holds and disclosure of account statements.

## 7. Judicial Remedies
- **Florida State Court:** File an ex parte motion for temporary restraining order (TRO) and writ of garnishment against identified accounts, citing ongoing fraud and dissipation risk.
- **Federal Court:** Prepare a complaint for conversion and money laundering with an accompanying TRO application to cover interstate and international transfers.
- **Receivership:** Nominate a receiver to control Zeig Law Firm PLLC assets, including the IOTA account.

## 8. Documentation and Tracking
- Maintain a freeze log capturing: date/time, institution contacted, person spoken with, reference numbers, and promised actions.
- Store all correspondence in a secure evidence repository accessible to FBI RAT, FinCEN, and IRS-CI contacts.
- Schedule twice-daily status checks with banks and agencies until written confirmation of freezes or seizures is received.

## 9. Escalation if Freeze Fails
- If CNB declines to act, escalate to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Ombudsman and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation with the evidence packet and refusal letter.
- Request expedited Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) support through DOJ’s Office of International Affairs for offshore accounts where voluntary holds are unavailable.
- Coordinate with correspondent banks to block further outbound wires from implicated SWIFT BICs pending adjudication.
