# Entity-Level Inference

This register documents the entity-level inference that maps each enumerated shell entity to the business it represents. The list is derived from the latest investigative notes and consolidates duplicate shell entries for clarity.[^1]

## Methodology Overview

The inference assignments were validated through a three-step review:

1. **Cross-check shell identifiers** against the *Electronic Dispatch Packet* ledger to confirm that each ID matches the underlying entity names in the AML briefing register.
2. **Verify corporate relationships** by comparing the dispatch packet entries with filings in the corporate registry summary maintained by the compliance archive.
3. **Document resolution notes** inside the investigative notebook so that duplicate shell companies point back to the same beneficial owner record.

This process ensures that recurring shell IDs are resolved to a single entity and that any deviations from the investigative packet are highlighted for further review.
