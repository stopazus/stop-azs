# Plaintiff's Motion for Default Judgment and Enforcement Demand

## I. Procedural Background
Plaintiff N & S Holding LLC ("Plaintiff"), by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully moves this Court, pursuant to Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.500(b), for the entry of a default judgment against Defendants Justin E. Zeig, Zeig Law Firm PLLC, Daniella Eisenstein, and Zachary Eisenstein (collectively, "Defendants"). In support, Plaintiff states as follows:

1. Plaintiff initiated this action to recover trust assets misappropriated from escrow accounts maintained for Plaintiff's property acquisitions.
2. Defendants were properly served but have failed to respond or otherwise defend the action within the time prescribed by law.
3. The Clerk entered a default against all Defendants on June 20, 2024.

## II. Findings of Fact Supporting Default Relief
4. Zeig Law Firm PLLC maintained a City National Bank IOTA escrow account ending in 7980 to facilitate Plaintiff's transactions.
5. On or about February 9, 2023, Justin Zeig authorized wire transfers from the IOTA escrow to pass-through account #2000043165557 and subsequently to entities lacking any legitimate nexus to Plaintiff's deals.
6. Records obtained from the AML Surveillance Unit show routing inconsistent with escrow instructions and identify beneficiaries YBH Holdings LLC, Eisenstein Buyers, and layered offshore accounts linked to Zeig-controlled structures.
7. Plaintiff's internal audit and IC3 Submission ID 7065f60922b948a59af3a8654edb16dd confirm that more than $7 million in escrow proceeds were diverted from the attorney trust account and layered through shell companies.
8. Investigations by federal and state authorities—including the FBI, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network—have identified that Defendants layered more than $7 million in victim funds through shell entities, including YBH Holdings 2948 LLC, BR Shell LLC (UK), and affiliated offshore accounts in Belize and Ben-Ham.
9. Defendants Daniella and Zachary Eisenstein knowingly assisted in the diversion and concealment of Plaintiff's trust assets misappropriated by Justin Zeig through the aforementioned entities and by facilitating transfers to high-risk offshore accounts in violation of the escrow's purpose and originating instructions.

## III. Relief Requested
10. Plaintiff respectfully requests entry of final default judgment against Defendants, jointly and severally, for damages in the amount of $7,000,000 plus prejudgment interest.
11. Plaintiff further seeks an order authorizing immediate enforcement remedies, including asset freezes, constructive trusts, and turnover of funds held by YBH Holdings LLC, Eisenstein Buyers, and related offshore structures.
12. Plaintiff additionally requests costs and attorneys' fees incurred in tracing, recovery, and enforcement efforts under applicable statutes and contractual provisions.
