## Plaintiff's Motion for Default Judgment and Enforcement Demand

Plaintiff N & S Holding LLC ("Plaintiff"), by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully moves this Court, pursuant to Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.500(b), for the entry of a default judgment against Defendants Justin E. Zeig, Zeig Law Firm PLLC, Daniella Eisenstein, and Zachary Eisenstein (collectively, "Defendants"). In support, Plaintiff states as follows:

### I. Procedural Background

1. Plaintiff initiated this action to recover trust assets allegedly misappropriated from escrow arrangements administered by Defendant Justin E. Zeig through City National Bank IOTA escrow account no. 2304977980.
2. Service of process has been effected upon each Defendant pursuant to the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, as evidenced by affidavits of service filed with the Court.
3. The Clerk entered defaults against each Defendant on the basis of their failure to plead or otherwise defend within the time prescribed by law.
4. Plaintiff now seeks the entry of a default judgment under Rule 1.500(b), together with such enforcement measures as are necessary to preserve and recover assets traceable to the misappropriated funds.

### II. Statement of Facts

5. Plaintiff is the intended beneficiary of escrowed funds tendered for legitimate investment and transactional purposes.
6. In early 2023, Plaintiff wired multiple payments, including Wire Ref. No. ZLG-070623-01, to the City National Bank escrow account controlled by Defendants Zeig and Zeig Law Firm PLLC.
7. The escrow ledger for account no. 2304977980 reflects that deposits into the account were immediately withdrawn in matching amounts, demonstrating that the account was used as a pass-through mechanism rather than a bona fide trust account.
8. Investigations by federal and state authorities—including the FBI, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network—have identified that Defendants layered more than $7 million in victim funds through shell entities, including YBH Holdings 2948 LLC, BR Shell LLC (UK), and affiliated offshore accounts linked to Yossef Ben-Hamo.
9. Defendants Daniella and Zachary Eisenstein knowingly assisted in the diversion and concealment of Plaintiff's trust funds by coordinating transfers through the aforementioned entities and by facilitating false documentation to disguise the nature and origin of the funds.
10. As a direct consequence of Defendants' conduct, Plaintiff suffered losses exceeding $7 million, comprising principal trust assets and associated damages.

### III. Legal Grounds for Default Judgment

11. Rule 1.500(b) authorizes the Court to enter a default judgment against parties who have been properly served and have failed to plead or otherwise defend.
12. By virtue of the Clerk's defaults, Defendants are deemed to have admitted the well-pleaded allegations of the Complaint, including liability for conversion, civil theft under section 772.11, Florida Statutes, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and unjust enrichment.
13. Plaintiff has established damages through sworn affidavits, documentary evidence, and forensic accounting tracing, demonstrating losses in excess of $7 million with supporting transaction records.

### IV. Demand for Relief and Enforcement Measures

Plaintiff requests that the Court enter final default judgment jointly and severally against all Defendants and award the following relief:

1. Monetary damages in the amount of $7,000,000.00, plus prejudgment interest accruing from the date of each misappropriated transfer.
2. Treble damages and attorneys' fees pursuant to section 772.11, Florida Statutes, for Defendants' willful conduct constituting civil theft.
3. Permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants and any persons acting in concert with them from dissipating, transferring, encumbering, or otherwise disposing of assets traceable to Plaintiff's funds.
4. Appointment of a receiver or special master to identify, secure, and repatriate assets held by Defendants or their affiliates, including YBH Holdings 2948 LLC, BR Shell LLC (UK), and accounts associated with Yossef Ben-Hamo.
5. Turnover orders directed to financial institutions, including City National Bank, Bank Hapoalim, and any correspondent banks involved in the layering transactions, compelling them to freeze and release to the receiver all funds and records related to the diverted escrow monies.
6. Authorization for expedited discovery and subpoenas to third parties to locate additional assets and to obtain forensic accounting records necessary for enforcement of the judgment.
7. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including continuing jurisdiction to enforce the judgment and oversee asset recovery.

### V. Certification and Request for Hearing

Plaintiff certifies that a copy of this Motion has been served upon all parties against whom a default judgment is sought in accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516. Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court set this Motion for hearing at the earliest opportunity, or in the alternative, enter the requested relief based on the written record and supporting affidavits filed contemporaneously herewith.
