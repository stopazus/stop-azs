## Plaintiff's Motion for Default Judgment and Enforcement Demand

Plaintiff [Plaintiff Legal Name] ("Plaintiff"), by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully moves this Court, pursuant to [Applicable Rule or Statute], for the entry of a default judgment against Defendants [Defendant 1 Legal Name], [Defendant 2 Legal Name], [Defendant 3 Legal Name], and [Defendant 4 Legal Name] (collectively, "Defendants"). In support, Plaintiff states as follows:

### I. Procedural Background

1. Plaintiff initiated this action to recover trust assets allegedly misappropriated from escrow arrangements administered by Defendant [Primary Defendant Name] through [Financial Institution] escrow account no. [Escrow Account Number].
2. Service of process has been effected upon each Defendant pursuant to the [Procedural Rules], as evidenced by affidavits of service filed with the Court.
3. The Clerk entered defaults against each Defendant on the basis of their failure to plead or otherwise defend within the time prescribed by law.
4. Plaintiff now seeks the entry of a default judgment under [Rule Citation], together with such enforcement measures as are necessary to preserve and recover assets traceable to the misappropriated funds.

### II. Statement of Facts

5. Plaintiff is the intended beneficiary of escrowed funds tendered for legitimate investment and transactional purposes.
6. In [Month, Year], Plaintiff wired multiple payments, including Wire Ref. No. [Reference Number], to the [Financial Institution] escrow account controlled by Defendants [Defendant Name(s)].
7. The escrow ledger for account no. [Escrow Account Number] reflects that deposits into the account were immediately withdrawn in matching amounts, demonstrating that the account was used as a pass-through mechanism rather than a bona fide trust account.
8. Investigations by federal and state authorities—including [Investigative Agency 1], [Investigative Agency 2], and [Investigative Agency 3]—have identified that Defendants layered more than [Dollar Amount] in victim funds through shell entities, including [Shell Entity 1], [Shell Entity 2], and affiliated offshore accounts linked to [Associated Party].
9. Defendants [Additional Defendant Names] knowingly assisted in the diversion and concealment of Plaintiff's trust funds by coordinating transfers through the aforementioned entities and by facilitating false documentation to disguise the nature and origin of the funds.
10. As a direct consequence of Defendants' conduct, Plaintiff suffered losses exceeding [Dollar Amount], comprising principal trust assets and associated damages.

### III. Legal Grounds for Default Judgment

11. [Rule Citation] authorizes the Court to enter a default judgment against parties who have been properly served and have failed to plead or otherwise defend.
12. By virtue of the Clerk's defaults, Defendants are deemed to have admitted the well-pleaded allegations of the Complaint, including liability for [Cause of Action 1], [Cause of Action 2], [Cause of Action 3], and unjust enrichment.
13. Plaintiff has established damages through sworn affidavits, documentary evidence, and forensic accounting tracing, demonstrating losses in excess of [Dollar Amount] with supporting transaction records.

### IV. Demand for Relief and Enforcement Measures

Plaintiff requests that the Court enter final default judgment jointly and severally against all Defendants and award the following relief:

1. Monetary damages in the amount of [Dollar Amount], plus prejudgment interest accruing from the date of each misappropriated transfer.
2. Treble damages and attorneys' fees pursuant to [Statutory Citation], for Defendants' willful conduct constituting [Cause of Action].
3. Permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants and any persons acting in concert with them from dissipating, transferring, encumbering, or otherwise disposing of assets traceable to Plaintiff's funds.
4. Appointment of a receiver or special master to identify, secure, and repatriate assets held by Defendants or their affiliates, including [Affiliate Entity 1], [Affiliate Entity 2], and accounts associated with [Associated Party].
5. Turnover orders directed to financial institutions, including [Financial Institution 1], [Financial Institution 2], and any correspondent banks involved in the layering transactions, compelling them to freeze and release to the receiver all funds and records related to the diverted escrow monies.
6. Authorization for expedited discovery and subpoenas to third parties to locate additional assets and to obtain forensic accounting records necessary for enforcement of the judgment.
7. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including continuing jurisdiction to enforce the judgment and oversee asset recovery.

### V. Certification and Request for Hearing

Plaintiff certifies that a copy of this Motion has been served upon all parties against whom a default judgment is sought in accordance with [Service Rule Citation]. Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court set this Motion for hearing at the earliest opportunity, or in the alternative, enter the requested relief based on the written record and supporting affidavits filed contemporaneously herewith.

Respectfully submitted,
