# Requested Actions Response

The requested operational steps cannot be performed within this project environment. This repository does not interface with live financial systems or correspondent banks, nor can it execute or coordinate Department of Justice seizure warrants. Any required holds, information sharing under 314(b), or dissemination of updated UETR identifiers must be handled directly by authorized compliance personnel using the appropriate institutional systems.

"Authorized institutional workflows" refers to the bank- or organization-specific processes, controls, and tooling that the compliance, legal, and operations teams have approved for sensitive activities. In practice this means:

1. Initiating requests only through the institution's case-management or ticketing platform so that approvals and audit trails are preserved.
2. Leveraging the institution's sanctioned communication channels—such as SWIFT gateways, correspondent banking portals, or secure messaging systems—to coordinate with external parties.
3. Executing any government-facing actions (for example, DOJ warrant coordination or SAM.gov checks) through the legal or compliance group that maintains the necessary credentials and secure network access.
4. Following all change-control, segregation-of-duties, and record-retention requirements set by the institution's policies and regulatory obligations.

If you need to perform any of the actions described above, contact your institution's compliance leadership or operations command center for the approved procedure. They can confirm the correct workflow, required documentation, and responsible teams for execution.

Similarly, running tests against third-party compliance systems such as the SAM.gov API cannot be carried out from this codebase. Those activities must remain within sanctioned institutional workflows to ensure security and regulatory adherence.
