# STS Submission Search – Filipino Localization

This document tracks the outstanding work required to restore the Filipino-language
material for the STS submission search flow. All content below remains sanitized and
contains no restricted data.

## Background
* The prior Filipino localization strings lived in “Share Drive One” alongside the other
  localized STS assets.
* The original copy could not be retained in this repository due to handling
  requirements.

## Required Inputs
1. **Sanitized Filipino search strings** – Provide the public-safe text that should appear
   for each STS search field.
2. **Localization review checklist** – Supply validation steps confirming the Filipino
   strings render correctly in the UI.
3. **Public references** – Include ticket numbers or knowledge base articles that can be
   cited without exposing restricted sources.

## Next Steps
* Once the inputs above are available, update this file with the localized strings and
  validation checklist.
* Mirror the structure used by the English STS documentation to maintain parity.
* Record the update date and contributor initials in a changelog section when the data is
  added.

## Changelog
* _2024-??-??_ – Pending restoration of sanitized Filipino localization details.
