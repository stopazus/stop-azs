# Appendix D: Inferred Ownership & Control Structure – 3049 Perriwinkle Circle

This appendix illustrates the inferred ownership and control structure for the property at 3049 Perriwinkle Circle. Based on deed metadata, escrow flow analysis, and offshore layering patterns, this structure highlights how shell entities and nominee holdings are used to obscure beneficial ownership and facilitate suspected laundering.

## Transaction & Wire Integration

- **TX1**: $5,000 → Shell Entity (purpose unclear, probable layering or consulting fee masking).
- **TX2**: $206,693.68 → Shannon G. Tomchin (also the deed grantor, indicating self-dealing).
- Wire memo anomalies such as `ZLG-XXXX-XX` suggest spoofed internal code formats inconsistent with legitimate bank records.
- Structuring characteristics include nominal deed consideration ($10), rerouting of funds through an escrow intermediary, and immediate cycling back to the grantor.

## Executive Findings

- Zeig Law Firm PLLC acted as escrow controller and document preparer.
- Tomchin appears both as grantor and escrow proceeds recipient, a red flag of circular laundering.
- Offshore entities including YBH Holdings 2948 LLC, Bitton Nominee Holdings, and Ben-Hamo Trust (Cayman) appear as inferred beneficiaries.
- This layered structure matches IRS/FinCEN typologies for real estate laundering.
