# stop-azs

## Overview
This repository tracks documentation and tooling requests related to the STOP-AZS compliance effort. All historical sensitive
materials have been purged to comply with handling requirements. Only non-confidential summaries and implementation details
should be stored here.

## Current Status
* The SAR, IC3, and IRS-CI submission artifacts that previously lived in this project were removed for security reasons.
* External sources (for example, Google Drive or email attachments) are not accessible from this environment.
* The `sts` submission checklist is missing the Filipino localization details referenced in recent correspondence.

## Requested Follow-Up
To restore the missing Filipino information in the STS submission search documentation, please provide:
1. Sanitized localization text for the Filipino version.
2. A validation checklist that shows how the localized content should appear in the search results.
3. Any public references or ticket numbers that can be cited without exposing restricted material.

Once the above items are available, they can be added to this repository in a new Markdown file (for example,
`docs/sts_submission_filipino.md`). Please avoid uploading restricted or personally identifiable information.

## Contributing Notes
* Keep all contributions free of confidential data.
* When updating documentation, include the date of the update and a short changelog entry.
* Share validation steps or test commands that can be run entirely within this repository.
