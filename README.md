## Transaction Narrative (2023-02-09)
- **Amount:** Pending confirmation (bank subpoena outstanding with Banesco USA).
- **Routing pattern:**
  1. Funds originated from an account titled **Zeig IOTA Escrow**.
  2. Transfers passed through intermediary accounts `#2304977980` and `#2000043165557`.
  3. Proceeds dispersed to **YBH Holdings LLC**, **Eisenstein Buyers**, and unspecified **layered offshore accounts**.
- **Notes from SAR:** Routing is inconsistent with escrow instructions and is suspected to support layering/structuring typologies. A Universal End-to-End Transaction Reference (UETR) is pending. Investigators noted that dollar values and UETR details will be provided once subpoena responses are returned.

## Alleged Suspicious Activity Types
- Wire fraud tied to escrow diversion.
- Money laundering with an emphasis on layering methodologies.
- Structuring behavior to obscure fund origin and final beneficiaries.

## Investigative Considerations
1. **Document requests:** Ensure subpoenas to Banesco USA and any correspondent institutions are tracked for timely fulfillment.
2. **Beneficiary verification:** Validate corporate formation data, beneficial ownership, and account relationships for YBH Holdings LLC and Eisenstein Buyers.
3. **Escrow controls review:** Compare alleged transaction routing with standard escrow disbursement instructions to identify potential control failures.
4. **Cross-border assistance:** Prepare Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) requests for any jurisdictions linked to the "layered offshore accounts" once identified.
5. **Evidence management:** Archive responses, banking records, and investigative analyses in the annex referenced in the SAR attachment.
