This repository provides resources for documenting and reviewing suspicious escrow account activity. The materials were drafted with
multi-agency recovery and enforcement workflows in mind, including cooperation with:

- FBI – Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) / Recovery Asset Team (RAT)
- FinCEN – BSA E-Filing Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)
- IRS – Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Fraud and Money Laundering Referral program

## Contents

- `docs/escrow_transaction_review.md` – A narrative template for compiling an investigative memorandum, including background
  context, ledger analysis, entity mapping, legal actions, regulator/law-enforcement coordination, and next steps.
- `data/ledger_analysis_template.csv` – A tabular structure for capturing deposits, withdrawals, counterparties, routing
  methods, and evidentiary references during a forensic review, along with agency referral tracking fields.

Use these templates as starting points, replacing the illustrative material with verified information gathered through lawful
investigative methods. Update the documents as facts evolve so that coordination notes, referral identifiers, and evidence links
remain accurate for all partner agencies.
