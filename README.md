This repository documents key allegations and participants in the alleged diversion of escrow funds
from the City National Bank trust account controlled by Justin E. Zeig. See [analysis.md](analysis.md)
for detailed background on the trust account activity, summaries of the shell entities involved,
captured case metadata, identified red flags, an expanded forensic ledger exhibit (as of 24 August
2025), and a concluding synthesis that ties the observed pass-through behavior to the ongoing
recovery and enforcement efforts.

## Windows NAS Bootstrap

The [windows-nas-bootstrap](windows-nas-bootstrap/) directory contains a Windows automation bundle that:
- Installs essential applications via winget (Python 3.12, Git, rclone, VS Code, 7-Zip, VLC, WinSCP, PuTTY)
- Maps NAS cloud storage drives (G:, I:, O:)
- Performs optional network speed tests

See [windows-nas-bootstrap/README.md](windows-nas-bootstrap/README.md) for usage instructions.

## Testing

The project currently has no automated test suite. A `pytest` run (August 2025) reports zero
collected tests, confirming that no executable checks are defined yet.
