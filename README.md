This repository documents key allegations and participants in the alleged diversion of escrow funds
from the City National Bank trust account controlled by Justin E. Zeig. See [analysis.md](analysis.md)
for detailed background on the trust account activity, summaries of the shell entities involved,
captured case metadata, identified red flags, and an expanded forensic ledger exhibit (as of 24
August 2025) that provides a master casebook index of the pass-through transactions and related
legal and regulatory actions.

## Testing

The project currently has no automated test suite. A `pytest` run (August 2025) reports zero
collected tests, confirming that no executable checks are defined yet.
