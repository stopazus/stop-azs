    "narrative_summary": "Diversion of escrowed sale proceeds owed to N & S Holding LLC (Florida Land Trust No. 2763-196). Despite written direction to pay the beneficiary, the title agent wired funds to an attorney IOTA escrow (Zeig Law Firm PLLC, City National Bank of Florida) on 2023-01-11. Indicators include contradiction of closing instructions, lack of 1099-S to beneficiary, internal references to a never-executed 'future transaction', and unresolved funds consistent with layering typologies in real-estate money laundering."
