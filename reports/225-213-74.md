# SAR Narrative – File 225-213/74

## Subject Information
- **Subject Role:** Buyer / Front Entity
- **Entity Name:** ZLG Holdings N.V.
- **Nominee Buyer:** Angela Henlon (a/k/a "Angie Henlon")
- **Property Address:** 2763 NW 196 Terrace, Miami Gardens, FL 33056
- **Mailing Address on Record:** Matches property address
- **Purchase Amount:** $275,000.00

## Summary of Suspicious Activity
ALTA file 225-213/74, recorded 2024-11-18, lists Angela Henlon as the nominee buyer of the referenced residential property while
vesting title in ZLG Holdings N.V., an offshore Naamloze Vennootschap. The offshore incorporation structure and the same address
for both the nominee and property indicate a front arrangement masking the beneficial owner. The closing documents reflect
Henlon receiving correspondence at 2763 NW 196 Terrace, mirroring the parcel address, which is consistent with a straw-purchase
setup shielding the true obligor. This structure is aligned with the Section 8 rent masking typology described in 31 CFR
§ 1010.320(b)(2), where federal housing subsidies are obscured through nominee purchasers and layered entities.

## Transaction Characteristics
- **Transaction Type:** Residential real estate acquisition
- **Recorded Owner:** ZLG Holdings N.V. (offshore corporation)
- **Control Mechanism:** Nominee buyer executing documents on behalf of offshore entity
- **Suspected Funding Source:** Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher proceeds diverted through the nominee
- **Observed Typology:** Section 8 rent masking with offshore layering

## Red Flags and Indicators
1. Title recorded to an offshore N.V. entity rather than the nominee buyer, obscuring beneficial ownership.
2. Nominee buyer provides the subject property as her own mailing address, signaling straw-buyer activity and limiting service
   of process options for counterparties.
3. Offshore layering consistent with attempts to hinder tracing of government-subsidized rent payments.
4. Lack of transparent beneficial ownership information for ZLG Holdings N.V. in domestic filings.
5. Transaction size ($275,000) is consistent with comparable subsidized properties and may facilitate rent stream diversion
   without triggering enhanced underwriting review thresholds.

## Investigative Considerations
- Obtain the HUD Form 50058 or Section 8 disbursement ledger tied to Angela Henlon to quantify subsidy proceeds potentially
  diverted into closing funds.
- Compare tenant/landlord certifications to identify whether ZLG Holdings N.V. is disclosed to the local Public Housing Agency
  or if rent reasonableness reviews still list Henlon individually.
- Query state corporate filings and cross-border registries for ZLG Holdings N.V. to identify directors or agents overlapping
  with other subsidy-fraud investigations.
- Review settlement statements for unusual credits, including rent overages, transfer of voucher proceeds, or third-party
  remittances associated with Henlon or ZLG Holdings N.V.
- Coordinate with the local Public Housing Agency to obtain any Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) contracts referencing the
  property to determine whether subsidy payments are routed through the nominee structure.
- Request bank account analyses for deposits tied to Section 8 vouchers that could have been redirected to the closing agent
  or offshore entity.
- Check tenant complaint databases or HUD Office of Inspector General referrals for prior allegations involving Henlon or
  ZLG Holdings N.V.
