# SAR Narrative – File 225-213/74

## Subject Information
- **Subject Role:** Buyer / Front Entity
- **Entity Name:** ZLG Holdings N.V.
- **Nominee Buyer:** Angela Henlon (a/k/a "Angie Henlon")
- **Property Address:** 2763 NW 196 Terrace, Miami Gardens, FL 33056
- **Mailing Address on Record:** Matches property address
- **Purchase Amount:** $275,000.00

## Summary of Suspicious Activity
ALTA file 225-213/74, recorded 2024-11-18, lists Angela Henlon as the nominee buyer of the referenced residential property while
vesting title in ZLG Holdings N.V., an offshore Naamloze Vennootschap. The offshore incorporation structure and the same address
for both the nominee and property indicate a front arrangement masking the beneficial owner. This structure is aligned with the
Section 8 rent masking typology described in 31 CFR § 1010.320(b)(2), where federal housing subsidies are obscured through
nominee purchasers and layered entities.

## Transaction Characteristics
- **Transaction Type:** Residential real estate acquisition
- **Recorded Owner:** ZLG Holdings N.V. (offshore corporation)
- **Control Mechanism:** Nominee buyer executing documents on behalf of offshore entity
- **Suspected Funding Source:** Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher proceeds diverted through the nominee
- **Observed Typology:** Section 8 rent masking with offshore layering

## Red Flags and Indicators
1. Title recorded to an offshore N.V. entity rather than the nominee buyer, obscuring beneficial ownership.
2. Nominee buyer provides the subject property as her own mailing address, signaling straw-buyer activity.
3. Offshore layering consistent with attempts to hinder tracing of government-subsidized rent payments.
4. Lack of transparent beneficial ownership information for ZLG Holdings N.V. in domestic filings.
5. Transaction size ($275,000) is consistent with comparable subsidized properties and may facilitate rent stream diversion.

## Recommended Actions
- File and reference a Suspicious Activity Report citing potential Section 8 rent masking under 31 CFR § 1010.320(b)(2).
- Coordinate with HUD-OIG to trace Housing Choice Voucher payments tied to the property and nominee.
- Initiate beneficial ownership inquiry on ZLG Holdings N.V. via MLAT or equivalent international assistance channels.
- Assess whether the nominee buyer has additional properties recorded under the offshore entity for pattern analysis.
