# SAR Narrative – File 225-213/74

## Subject Information
- **Nominee Buyer:** Angela Henlon (a/k/a "Angie Henlon")
- **Property Address:** 2763 NW 196 Terrace, Miami Gardens, FL 33056
- **Reported Mailing Address:** Same as property
- **Associated Entity:** ZLG Holdings N.V. (foreign incorporation in Netherlands Antilles)

## Summary of Suspicious Activity
On 2024-11-18, title documentation identified as ALTA file 225-213/74 lists Angela Henlon as the nominee buyer of the above-referenced residential property. The warranty deed recorded the transaction under ZLG Holdings N.V., an offshore corporation. ZLG Holdings N.V. is classified as a Naamloze Vennootschap (N.V.), which is a bearer-share friendly structure commonly employed to obscure beneficial ownership.

Supporting documentation shows that the reported mailing address for Ms. Henlon matches the property address itself. The transaction structure indicates that Henlon acted as a straw purchaser or nominee buyer to cloak the true owner’s identity. This structure is consistent with red flags for masking rent-stream beneficiaries tied to Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher proceeds in violation of 31 CFR § 1010.320(b)(2).

## Transaction Characteristics
- **Transaction Type:** Real estate purchase (residential)
- **Purchase Vehicle:** Offshore corporation (ZLG Holdings N.V.)
- **Potential Funding Source:** Section 8 rent proceeds rerouted through nominee buyer
- **Observed Typology:** Rent masking and nominee ownership layering

## Indicators
1. Property recorded to an offshore N.V. entity rather than the resident nominee buyer.
2. Nominee buyer lists the subject property as her mailing address, signaling straw-buyer activity.
3. Layering via offshore incorporation to hinder identification of Section 8 rent beneficiaries.
4. Lack of transparent beneficial ownership information for ZLG Holdings N.V.

## Recommended Actions
- File Suspicious Activity Report referencing potential Section 8 rent masking.
- Consider tracing Housing Choice Voucher payments linked to the property.
- Initiate beneficial ownership inquiry for ZLG Holdings N.V. through MLAT or mutual assistance channels.
- Notify HUD-OIG and IRS-CI for possible housing subsidy fraud and money laundering nexus.
